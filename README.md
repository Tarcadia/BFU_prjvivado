# BFU_prjvivado
BrainFuck Unit
This is a BrainFuck-based processing unit. The Junction Block (JB) is the core of it, other parts serves as peripheral devices.
In JB, D is the data input; DO is the data output; DT is the writing trigger; DSL means shift the data belt left; DSR means shift it right; C is the code input; CSL means shift code belt left; CSR means shift code belt right; I is the IO input; IF is the input flag; IOVF is the input overflow flag; IT is IO input read trigger; O is the IO output; OOVF is the output overflow flag; OT is the output trigger. After all no one would come and find this project. Code is short, find functions in it and no rm anymore.
